## Coming Soon

-  **Authentication** - User authentication and session management

## Installation

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended for Production)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chriswritescode-dev/opencode-manager.git
cd opencode-manager

# Start with Docker Compose (single container)
docker-compose up -d

# Access the application at http://localhost:5001
```

The Docker setup automatically:
- Installs OpenCode if not present
- Builds and serves frontend from backend
- Sets up persistent volumes for workspace and database
- Includes health checks and auto-restart

**Docker Commands:**
```bash
# Start container
docker-compose up -d

# Stop and remove container
docker-compose down

# Rebuild image
docker-compose build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart container
docker-compose restart

# Access container shell
docker exec -it opencode-manager sh
```

### Dev Server Ports

The Docker container exposes ports `5100-5103` for running dev servers inside your repositories. Configure your project's dev server to use one of these ports and access it directly from your browser.

**Example usage:**
```bash
# Vite (vite.config.ts)
server: { port: 5100, host: '0.0.0.0' }

# Next.js
next dev -p 5100 -H 0.0.0.0

# Express/Node
app.listen(5100, '0.0.0.0')
```

Access your dev server at `http://localhost:5100` (or your Docker host IP).

To customize the exposed ports, edit `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "5003:5003"      # OpenCode Manager
  - "5100:5100"      # Dev server 1
  - "5101:5101"      # Dev server 2
  - "5102:5102"      # Dev server 3
  - "5103:5103"      # Dev server 4
```

### Global Agent Instructions (AGENTS.md)

OpenCode Manager creates a default `AGENTS.md` file in the workspace config directory (`/workspace/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`). This file provides global instructions to AI agents working within the container.

**Default instructions include:**
- Reserved ports (5003 for OpenCode Manager, 5551 for OpenCode server)
- Available dev server ports (5100-5103)
- Guidelines for binding to `0.0.0.0` for Docker accessibility

**Editing AGENTS.md:**
- Via UI: Settings > OpenCode > Global Agent Instructions
- Via file: Edit `/workspace/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` directly

This file is merged with any repository-specific `AGENTS.md` files, with repository instructions taking precedence for their respective codebases.

### Option 2: Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chriswritescode-dev/opencode-manager.git
cd opencode-manager

# Install dependencies (uses Bun workspaces)
bun install

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Start development servers (backend + frontend)
npm run dev
```

## OAuth Provider Setup

OpenCode WebUI supports OAuth authentication for select providers, offering a more secure and convenient alternative to API keys.

### Supported OAuth Providers

- **Anthropic (Claude)** - OAuth login with Claude Pro/Max accounts
- **GitHub Copilot** - OAuth device flow authentication

### Setting Up OAuth

1. **Navigate to Settings → Provider Credentials**
2. **Select a provider** that shows the "OAuth" badge
3. **Click "Add OAuth"** to start the authorization flow
4. **Choose authentication method:**
   - **"Open Authorization Page"** - Opens browser for sign-in
   - **"Use Authorization Code"** - Provides code for manual entry
5. **Complete authorization** in the browser or enter the provided code
6. **Connection status** will show as "Configured" when successful
